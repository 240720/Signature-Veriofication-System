Welcome to the Signature Verification System repository! 
This Django-based project allows users to upload and verify signatures by comparing uploaded signatures against a stored database using image similarity metrics. The system leverages Python's Pillow and OpenCV libraries for image processing and uses the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to calculate the similarity between images
