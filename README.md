# Signature-Veriofication-System
Welcome to the Signature Verification System repository! This project aims to provide a reliable and efficient solution for authenticating signatures using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques.

How It Works:
Signature Upload: Users can upload signature images via a web interface. The system supports various image formats for compatibility.
Preprocessing: Signature images undergo preprocessing to enhance quality and extract key features. This includes noise reduction, resizing, and normalization.
Feature Extraction: Advanced image processing techniques are used to extract unique features from the signature, creating a signature profile.
Matching Algorithm: Extracted features are compared against stored profiles using a sophisticated matching algorithm. A similarity score above a predefined threshold (e.g., 90%) indicates a match.
Result Display: The system displays clear and concise results, indicating whether the signature is verified. Detailed information about the verification process is also available.
